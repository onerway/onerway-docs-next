## Tour of the API

The Onerway APIs are powerful and flexible if you know how to use them. This tour covers key information to help you understand the APIs more deeply:

- The core concepts we use across the APIs
- The path a successful payment takes
- The objects that play a role and how to determine when they're needed
- Common patterns and best practices for using those objects together

Understanding these patterns helps you move beyond the pre-written code in Onerway tutorials. You can combine simple patterns in novel ways and plan for future growth.

## Core concepts

### Transaction lifecycle

Every transaction in Onerway is tracked using a unique transaction ID. Whether it's a forward payment, refund, or dispute, Onerway generates a transaction ID that follows the payment through its entire lifecycle.

Each checkout session has a 30-minute lifecycle, during which customers can complete their payment. After this window, the session expires and a new session must be created.

You can [query transaction status](#){badge="TODO"} to check the current state of any transaction ID.

### Structured data objects

Onerway uses structured data objects to handle payment information. Each API request follows a clearly defined data structure to ensure accuracy, completeness, and security.

A payment request consists of multiple data objects, each responsible for transmitting specific types of information:

#### Core transaction objects

| Object | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `TxnOrderMsg` | Order and merchant context | Return URL, notification URL, product list, customer platform, browser fingerprint data |
| `Products` | Line items for the order | Product name, price, quantity, currency, type (physical/virtual/discount/shipping) |
| `TransactionAddress` | Customer contact and location | Email (required), name, phone, postal code, full address, country (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) |

#### Payment method objects

| Object | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `CardInfo` | Card payment credentials | Cardholder name, card number, expiration month/year, CVV security code |
| `TokenInfo` | Saved payment methods | Token identifier for repeat payments without re-entering card details |
| `LpmsInfo` | Local payment configuration | Payment method type (e.g., WeChat, Alipay), regional wallet settings |

#### Security and subscription objects

| Object | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `mpiInfo` | 3D Secure authentication | ECI (Electronic Commerce Indicator), CAVV, XID (v1) or dsTransID (v2) |
| `Subscription` | Recurring billing setup | Billing cycle (frequency type/point), trial period (days/end date), expiration, notification email |

::tip
**Data format**: All nested objects must be serialized as JSON strings before submission. For example, `cardInfo` is passed as a stringified JSON object, not a native object.
::

**Example structure:**

```json
{
  "merchantNo": "800209",
  "merchantTxnId": "txn-12345",
  "orderAmount": "99.99",
  "orderCurrency": "USD",
  "productType": "CARD",
  "subProductType": "DIRECT",
  "txnType": "SALE",
  "txnOrderMsg": "{\"returnUrl\":\"https://example.com/return\",\"notifyUrl\":\"https://example.com/webhook\",\"products\":\"[{...}]\"}",
  "cardInfo": "{\"holderName\":\"John Doe\",\"cardNumber\":\"4111111111111111\",\"month\":\"12\",\"year\":\"25\",\"cvv\":\"123\"}",
  "billingInformation": "{\"email\":\"customer@example.com\",\"country\":\"US\",...}",
  "shippingInformation": "{\"email\":\"customer@example.com\",\"country\":\"US\",...}"
}
```

Regardless of how you integrate Onerway—through direct API calls, SDK integration, or hosted checkout—you need to organize and transmit information according to these predefined structures.

## Integration methods

Onerway offers multiple integration options to meet different business needs. Each option balances user experience, development complexity, and brand presentation differently.

::prose-tabs

  :::prose-tabs-item{label="Hosted Checkout"}

  Redirect customers to an Onerway-hosted payment page. This option minimizes frontend development work and gets you up and running quickly.

  **How it works:**

  1. Your server calls the Checkout API to create a payment order
  2. Onerway returns a response with `status: U` and a `redirectUrl`
  3. Redirect the customer to the `redirectUrl`
  4. The customer completes payment on Onerway's hosted page
  5. After payment, the customer returns to your specified `returnUrl`

    ::callout{type="info"}
    **PCI compliance**: Onerway handles all sensitive card data, so your integration is automatically PCI compliant without additional certification.
    ::

  **Best for**: Businesses that want the fastest time to market with minimal development effort.

  :::

  :::prose-tabs-item{label="Embedded Checkout"}

  Embed the payment form directly on your website using the Onerway JavaScript SDK. This option keeps customers on your site throughout the payment flow while maintaining brand consistency.

  **How it works:**

  1. Your server creates a Payment Intent via the API
  2. Onerway returns a response with `status: U`, a `redirectUrl`, and a `transactionID`
  3. Pass the `redirectUrl` and `transactionID` to your frontend
  4. Load the Onerway JavaScript SDK on your page
  5. Use the SDK to render an embedded payment form
  6. The customer completes payment without leaving your site

    ::callout{type="info"}
    **PCI compliance**: Card data is transmitted directly to Onerway, so you remain PCI compliant while keeping customers on your site.
    ::

  **Best for**: Businesses that want to maintain their visual brand while reducing development complexity.

  :::

  :::prose-tabs-item{label="Direct API"}

  Build a completely custom payment interface by collecting payment information on your frontend and submitting it to Onerway via direct API calls.

  **How it works:**

  1. Build a custom payment form on your frontend
  2. The customer enters payment information in your form
  3. Your frontend submits the payment data to your server
  4. Your server calls the Onerway API to process the payment
  5. Handle the response and display the result to the customer

    ::callout{type="warning"}
    **PCI compliance required**: Because you collect sensitive card data, you must maintain PCI DSS compliance. This option requires more security infrastructure and regular compliance audits.
    ::

  **Best for**: Businesses that need complete control over the payment experience and have the resources to maintain PCI compliance.

## Choose your integration path

The following table compares the three integration options to help you choose the best fit for your business:

| Feature | Hosted Checkout | Embedded Checkout | Direct API |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Setup complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **PCI compliance** | Onerway handles | Onerway handles | You handle |
| **UI customization** | Limited | Moderate | Full control |
| **Branding** | Shows Onerway | Minimal Onerway | No Onerway branding |
| **User experience** | Redirect required | On-page | Fully customized |
| **Time to integrate** | Fastest | Moderate | Longest |

Each option has trade-offs between development time, customization, and compliance requirements. Choose based on your technical resources and business needs.
