title: Set Payment Methods
description: Learn how to configure a range of global payment methods using the lpmsInfo parameter.
draft: true
---

The `lpmsInfo` parameter allows you to accept a variety of payment methods through a single API. The `lpmsInfo` object contains the payment method details required to create payments.

Combine `lpmsInfo` with `productType` to control which payment methods appear:

- Display all enabled payment methods on the Onerway hosted page:

```json
{
  "productType": "ALL"
}
```

- Display only a specific payment method on the hosted page:

```json
{
  "productType": "ALL",
  "lpmsInfo": "{\"lpmsType\":\"Skrill\"}"
}
```

## Supported payment methods

To determine which payment methods to use for specific locales, see the [payment methods guide](#){badge="TODO"}.

The guide includes available payment methods for different regions, detailed descriptions of each payment method's characteristics, and the geographic regions where they're most relevant. You can enable any available payment methods in the [Dashboard](#){badge="TODO"}. Activation is generally instantaneous and doesn't require additional contracts.

## Customer actions

Some payment methods require your customer to take additional steps to complete the payment. The API response specifies the type of customer action through the `actionType` parameter.

Common actions that customers need to perform include:

- **Redirect to bank page**: Redirect to the customer's bank online service to authenticate and approve the payment. (`actionType: RedirectURL`)
- **Scan QR code**: Display a QR code for the customer to scan and complete payment. (`actionType: QrCode`)
- **Invoke wallet app**: Based on the `codeForm` and `presentContext` values in the response, request the corresponding wallet SDK to launch the customer's mobile wallet during payment (for example, WeChat Pay). (`actionType: ShowContext`)

Card payments typically don't require additional customer actions, except when 3DS verification is required. 3DS verification requires further authentication after collecting card details.

## Immediate or delayed notification

Some payment methods immediately return payment status when a transaction is attempted (for example, card payments), while others have a delay (for example, Trustly).

For payment methods with immediate confirmation, you can confirm successful payment (`status: S`) through:

- Receiving a webhook notification
- Polling the query API after the customer redirects to your `returnUrl`

Payment methods with delayed notification can't guarantee payment during the delay period. The status remains `P` until the payment succeeds or fails. During this time, many businesses hold orders in a *pending* state, waiting to fulfill the order until payment succeeds.

For payment methods with delayed notification, configure webhook endpoints to receive final payment status notifications.

## Single-use or reusable

You can reuse certain payment methods (for example, cards or bank debits) for additional payments without authorizing and collecting payment details again.

To reduce the chance of future declines and payment friction (such as [required authentication](#){badge="TODO"}), always set up reusable payment methods for future use. Reusable payment methods can be set up when accepting a payment or set up without taking a payment.

Single-use payment methods (for example, some types of bank transfers) can't be attached to customers because they're consumed after a payment attempt.
