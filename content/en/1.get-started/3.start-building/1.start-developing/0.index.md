title: Integration Overview
description: Understand the 7-step integration workflow—from kickoff meeting to production launch with Onerway support.
---

Before writing code, understand the end-to-end integration workflow. Onerway provides dedicated support at each stage:

- **Test safely.** Run functional and regression tests in the isolated **Sandbox**. No impact on production.
- **Manage centrally.** Configure **API keys**, payment methods, risk rules, and subscription settings in one place.
- **Automate events.** Subscribe to asynchronous callback events for each critical transaction and subscription stage.

## Integration process overview

When integrating a new Onerway payment method, follow these 7 steps:

1. **Kickoff meeting** — An Onerway MI (Merchant Integration) representative invites you to a pre-integration meeting. Confirm which payment methods and APIs you will use.
2. **Review documentation** — Begin reviewing our [API documentation](https://docs.onerway.com/apis/).
3. **Technical meeting** — Onerway MI schedules a technical session with your developers to address API questions.
4. **Integrate APIs** — Use the **Sandbox** account credentials to perform the integration.
5. **Test in Sandbox** — Execute tests according to the provided test cases.
6. **Configure risk rules** — Align on the risk control (fraud prevention) strategy.
7. **Go live** — Complete production validation.

## Pre-integration kickoff meeting

Onerway provides payment recommendations based on your business situation. During this meeting:

- Confirm which payment methods you need
- Identify which APIs to use for your payment scenarios
- Discuss timeline and integration scope

## Review the API documentation

Review the APIs confirmed during the kickoff meeting in our [API documentation](https://docs.onerway.com/apis/). Note down any questions about API usage—we will discuss them in the technical meeting.

## Address API questions in a technical meeting

This meeting is primarily for your development team. Onerway will:

- Introduce each API you need to use in detail
- Answer questions you encountered while reviewing the documentation
- Provide integration best practices

## Integrate Onerway APIs

Integrate Onerway's APIs into your website or application. Throughout the process, Onerway provides support to help you complete the integration.

::note
Complete all integration work in the **Sandbox** environment first. Switch to production only after passing all test cases.
::

## Test your integration in Sandbox

After integration is complete, test according to your business scenarios and complete Onerway's test cases.

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| **Sandbox** | `https://sandbox-acq.onerway.com` |
| **Production** | `https://acq.onerway.com` |

## Configure fraud prevention rules

After completing the testing phase, you can execute the entire payment flow in Sandbox. Before going live, discuss risk control strategies with Onerway based on your business scenarios.

## Go live with production credentials

Replace the following with your **production** account credentials:

- API request base URL
- **Merchant ID**
- **Secret key**
- **Application ID**

Then complete a real payment verification. After successful validation, your integration is ready for live transactions.

::warning
Never hardcode API credentials in your source code. Use environment variables or your platform's secret manager.
