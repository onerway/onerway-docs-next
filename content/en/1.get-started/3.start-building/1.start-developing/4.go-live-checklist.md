Onerway has designed its sandbox and production environments to function as similarly as possible. Switching between them is mostly a matter of swapping your [API keys](/get-started/start-building/start-developing/set-up-your-development-environment#get-your-api-credentials).

Complete the following steps to ensure your integration is production-ready.

Before you go live, make sure you:

- Test your integration with edge cases
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Set up proper logging
- Configure webhook endpoints correctly
- Subscribe to API updates

## Quick checklist

Copy this checklist to track your progress:

- [ ] Tested with incomplete, invalid, and duplicate data
- [ ] Error handling covers all scenarios
- [ ] Logs configured (excluding sensitive data)
- [ ] Production webhook endpoint verified
- [ ] Webhook handles delays and duplicates
- [ ] Subscribed to API update notifications
- [ ] Ready to switch API keys to production

## Test edge cases

Use our test values to verify your integration handles:

- **Incomplete data** - Missing required fields or partial payloads
- **Invalid data** - Incorrect formats, out-of-range values, or type mismatches
- **Duplicate requests** - Retry the same request to verify idempotency

::note
Have a non-technical team member test your integration to catch user experience issues developers might miss.
::

## Test error handling

Verify your integration handles all error scenarios before going live.

### Error types to test

| Error Category | Examples | User Display |
|----------------|----------|--------------|
| Payment rejection | Insufficient funds, invalid card | Show payment-specific error message |
| Validation errors | Missing fields, invalid format | Highlight specific field errors |
| Server errors | Timeout, 5xx responses | Show generic "try again" message |

::warning
Don't expose internal error details to users. Payment rejections and validation errors require different messaging.
::

## Set up logging

Onerway logs every API request in the management platform. You should also maintain your own logs as backup for scenarios like:

- Network issues preventing requests from reaching Onerway
- API key problems that prevent request logging

### Log security checklist

Regularly audit your logs to ensure they:

- [ ] Contain only necessary operational data
- [ ] Exclude credit card numbers
- [ ] Exclude personally identifiable information (PII)
- [ ] Exclude API keys and secrets

## Review your webhooks

You may have different webhook endpoints in your sandbox and production environments. Verify that:

- The `notifyUrl` parameter matches your production endpoint
- Your production endpoint behaves identically to your test endpoint

### Handle webhook edge cases

When processing webhooks in production, handle the following scenarios:

#### Delayed notifications

If the API response payment result indicates a final state, you can update the merchant order status. The following status codes represent final states:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `S` | Success |
| `F` | Failed |

If returning via `returnUrl` redirect, request the Onerway [Query API](https://docs.onerway.com/apis/en/v0.6/order-query){badge="API"} to query the order's final state.

If no result is found, use the following polling frequency to query for transaction results:

- 10 seconds
- 30 seconds
- 60 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 10 minutes
- 30 minutes

#### Duplicate notifications

After receiving a webhook notification, return the `transactionID` from the notification to Onerway to prevent duplicate notifications.

## Next steps

After completing this checklist:

1. **Subscribe to API updates** - Join our mailing list to receive notifications about new features and changes
2. **Switch to production** - Update your API keys and merchant ID
3. **Monitor your integration** - Watch for errors in your first transactions

::note
Keep this checklist for future reference when launching new integrations or updating existing ones.
