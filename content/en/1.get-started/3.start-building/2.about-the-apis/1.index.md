## Prerequisites

Before you start building with Onerway APIs, you need to:

- Create a sandbox account for testing
- Obtain your API credentials (merchant number, secret key, and Application ID)
- Configure the :prose-annotation{annotation="used to request Onerway API" text="base URL"}

## Initial Setup

  ### Create a Sandbox Account

  #content
  To create a sandbox account, provide your :prose-annotation{annotation="used to receive login credentials" text="email"} and the :prose-annotation{annotation="used to verify payment request origin" text="domain"} where you'll integrate payments. Onerway will typically set up your testing environment within 1–2 business days.

  ### Get Your API Credentials

  #content
  After your sandbox account is ready, log in to the [**Sandbox Portal**](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/user/login){glossary="sandbox"} to retrieve your API credentials:

    ::::warning
    Never expose your Secret Key in client-side code or commit it to source control. Use environment variables or your platform's secret manager.
    ::::

  - **[Merchant number](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/account/info)** - Account identifier
  - **[Secret key](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/account/info)** - API authentication key
  - **[Application ID (App ID)](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/application/list)** - Store identifier

  ### Set Up Base URL

  #content
  Configure the appropriate base URL for your environment:

    ::::note
    Always use the sandbox URL during development and testing to avoid processing real transactions. Do not mix sandbox credentials with production URLs (or vice versa).
    ::::

  | Environment | Base URL |
  | ----------- | -------- |
  | **Sandbox**     | `https://sandbox-acq.onerway.com`  |
  | **Production**  | `https://acq.onerway.com`          |

  Example environment variable configuration:

  ```yaml [env.yaml]
  ONERWAY_BASE_URL=https://sandbox-acq.onerway.com
  ```
