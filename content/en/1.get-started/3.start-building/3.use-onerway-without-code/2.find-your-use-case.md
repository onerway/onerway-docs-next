## E-commerce platform integrations

Choose your platform below. Most platforms support :prose-annotation[Card Payments (on-site)]{annotation="Checkout is embedded directly in your store's checkout page. Customers enter card information without leaving your site."} and :prose-annotation[Local Payments (off-site)]{annotation="Customers are redirected to the Onerway checkout page to choose from card and various local payment methods."} integration modes.
