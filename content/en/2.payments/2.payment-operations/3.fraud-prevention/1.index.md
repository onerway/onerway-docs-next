When you submit a card payment to a :prose-annotation[card network]{annotation="The organization that processes transactions for a specific card brand, such as Visa, Mastercard, or American Express."} for authorization, Onerway provides the CVC, postal code, and billing street address for them to verify (if you collected these from the customer in your checkout flow).

The card issuer checks this information against what they have on file for the cardholder. If the provided information doesn't match, the verification check fails.

A failed CVC or postal code check can indicate the payment is fraudulent, so review it carefully before fulfilling the order.

~Each [Charge](#){badge="TODO"} object includes the [verification response](#){badge="TODO"} as part of its `source` attribute. You can also find the verification results in the [Dashboard](#){badge="TODO"} when viewing a payment.~

If no information is collected, the card issuer can't perform a verification check. Collect the CVC, postal code, and billing address for every payment to avoid this issue. The results of verification checks help improve the detection of fraudulent activity.

## Verification check results

| Check | Pass                     | Fail                 | Unavailable            |
| ----- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| CVC   | Card possession verified | Potential fraud risk | Check not performed    |
| AVS   | Address matches records  | Address mismatch     | Issuer doesn't support |

## Use CVC checks to verify card possession

The CVC (or CVV) is the three- or four-digit number printed directly on a card that only cardholders in physical possession of the card should have access to. When you require the CVC value with a card payment method (during payment or when attaching the payment method to a customer's profile), the card issuer verifies the value during transaction authorization.

~After enabling a [rule](#){badge="TODO"} in the [Dashboard](#){badge="TODO"}~, payments that fail card issuer verification are blocked in various scenarios. This doesn't affect payments where the CVC check couldn't be performed or is unavailable. For example, :prose-annotation[wallets]{annotation="A digital wallet is a contactless payment method that stores payment options such as credit and debit cards, allowing customers to shop using smart devices."} like Apple Pay or :prose-annotation[off-session]{annotation="A payment that doesn't involve direct customer participation, using previously collected payment information."} payments don't require it.

Businesses can't store the CVC number, so fraudsters are unlikely to obtain the CVC through a computer breach, making CVC verification an effective fraud prevention tool. However, CVC verification doesn't protect against the physical theft of a card, nor computers or websites with poor security.

::tip
Collect CVC for every payment to maximize fraud protection. Most card issuers block payments that fail CVC verification.

## Use AVS to verify billing address

When you require the postal code and billing street address with a card payment method (during payment or when attaching the payment method to a customer's profile), the card issuer performs an AVS check to verify that they match the billing address on file.

~After enabling a [rule](#){badge="TODO"} in the [Dashboard](#){badge="TODO"}~, payments that fail postal code (AVS) verification are blocked in various scenarios. AVS checks can fail for legitimate payments. For example, a customer who enters their address incorrectly or moves without notifying their card issuer might see payments where the address check fails.

Support for AVS checks varies by country and card issuer. For example, certain countries don't use a postal code, and some card issuers don't support street address verification. Most cards issued in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom support street address verification.
