A dispute (also known as a chargeback) occurs when a cardholder questions your payment with their :prose-annotation[card issuer]{annotation="The bank or card network that issues payment cards to cardholders."}.

To process a chargeback, the issuer creates a formal dispute on the :prose-annotation[card network]{annotation="The organization (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, American Express) that processes card transactions."}, which immediately reverses the payment. This pulls the money for the payment—as well as one or more network dispute fees—from Onerway. After that, Onerway debits your balance for the payment amount and dispute fee.

To help you respond effectively to each dispute, Onerway guides you through the process in the [Dashboard](https://portal.onerway.com/user/login). Here, you can provide the appropriate text and images for the [dispute reason](#){badge="TODO"} and submit your counterargument. If you need help with a dispute, [contact support](#){badge="TODO"}.
