## Prerequisites

Before you start building with Onerway APIs, you need to:

- Create a sandbox account for testing
- Obtain your API credentials (merchant number, secret key, and Application ID)
- Configure the [base URL](){tooltip="used to request Onerway API"}

## Initial Setup

::accordion

defaultValue: ["0", "1", "2"]

  :::accordion-item{label="Create a Sandbox Account" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}

    ::::h4{class="sr-only"}
    Create a Sandbox Account
    ::::

  To create a sandbox account, provide your [**email**](){tooltip="used to receive login credentials"} and the [**domain**](){tooltip="used to verify payment request origin"} where you'll integrate payments. Onerway will typically set up your testing environment within 1â€“2 business days.

  :::accordion-item{label="Get Your API Credentials" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}

    ::::h4{class="sr-only"}
    Get Your API Credentials
    ::::

  After your sandbox account is ready, log in to the [**Sandbox Portal**](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/user/login){glossary="sandbox"} to retrieve your API credentials:

    ::::warning
    Never expose your Secret Key in client-side code or commit it to source control. Use environment variables or your platform's secret manager.
    ::::

  - **[Merchant number](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/account/info)** - Account identifier
  - **[Secret key](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/account/info)** - API authentication key
  - **[Application ID (App ID)](https://sandbox-portal.onerway.com/application/list)** - Store identifier

  :::

  :::accordion-item{label="Set Up Base URL" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}

    ::::h4{class="sr-only"}
    Set Up Base URL
    ::::

  Configure the appropriate base URL for your environment:

    ::::note
    Always use the sandbox URL during development and testing to avoid processing real transactions. Do not mix sandbox credentials with production URLs (or vice versa).
    ::::

  | Environment | Base URL |
  | ----------- | -------- |
  | **Sandbox**     | `https://sandbox-acq.onerway.com`  |
  | **Production**  | `https://acq.onerway.com`          |

  Example environment variable configuration:

  ```yaml [env.yaml]
  ONERWAY_BASE_URL=https://sandbox-acq.onerway.com
  ```
